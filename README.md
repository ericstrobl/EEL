# Extract Errors with Latents (EEL)

EEL is an algorithm that discovers sample-specific root causes even when confounding exists among the predictors. The algorithm also identifies the sample-specific total effects of each root cause. EEL is designed to handle a noisy binary target -- like a diagnostic label -- and is therefore particularly suitable for identifying root causes of disease.
